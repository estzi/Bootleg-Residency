## Fluorescent fixtures

### [Fluorescent Dimming](http://www.etcconnect.com/Community/wikis/products/fluorescent-dimming.aspx)

It is important to realize when dimming fluorescents that it is impossible to create a smooth transition between "off" and a level. Because light is generated by a discharge through gas, similar to an arc lamp or neon tube, there will always be a "jump" in light level when the tube initially strikes. The brightness to which the level "jumps" is determined by the ballast - see the section below on dimmable percentages. Always remember when dimming fluorescents, performance will not be the same as a traditional, dimmable, incandescent lamp.

### Dimming techniques
Phase dimming, SCR dimming.

### Potential problems
Dimming could create interference with audio. Will need to purchase housing for each bulb. Will need to purchase dimmer packs. Needs custom wiring.
